## Alive and Kicking
**[MicroBlocks](http://microblocks.fun)** - A dynamic, live, autonomous, concurrent, blocks-based language for 32 bit microcontrollers. With [John Maloney](https://harc.ycr.org/member/john_maloney/) and [Jens Mönig](https://github.com/jmoenig).  
**[Snap Site](https://snap.berkeley.edu)** - The Snap*!* community website. With [Michael Ball](https://mball.co/).  
**[Snap!Cloud](https://snap.berkeley.edu/static/API)** - The new Snap*!* cloud, a rather small backend service serving over 800,000 users and 8,000,000 projects. With [Michael Ball](https://mball.co/).  
**[Snap Arcade Machine](http://snaparcade.cat)** - A free (as in free speech) full sized arcade cabinet where people can write their own games using Snap*!*. With [Rita](http://gamifi.cat) and [Chris](http://gatopelao.org/)).  


## Metamorphosed into something else
**[Beetle Blocks](http://beetleblocks.com)** - Dynamically control a 3D beetle in a blocks programming environment based in Snap*!* to build 3D-printable things. With [Eric Rosenbaum](https://www.ericrosenbaum.com/) and [Duks Koschitz](https://www.pratt.edu/faculty_and_staff/bio/?id=duks). Now rewritten from scratch into an official Snap*!* extension.  
**[Beetle Cloud](https://github.com/bromagosa/beetleCloud)** - Parallel cloud for Beetle Blocks, plus its sharing site. It was the basis on which we later built the Snap*!* cloud.  


## Alive but maintained by someone else now
**[Snap4Arduino](http://snap4arduino.rocks)** - Control Arduino boards with Snap*!*, available in 10 different flavors. With [Joan Guillén](http://github.com/jguille2).  


## Archaeology
**[Snippets](https://github.com/bromagosa/Snippets)** - A naive shell-script-only web frontend template system. Snippets is Not (In Principle) a Perfect, Exhaustive Template System, but it did the job for the Snap*!* site for an alarmingly long time.  
**[Snapi*!*](http://snapi.citilab.eu)** - A Snap*!* mod aimed at working with APIs and OpenData. With [Edutec](http://edutec.citilab.eu).  
**[Ludus](http://bromagosa.github.io/Ludus/)** - Build HTML5 games in Amber Smalltalk, all without leaving your browser.  
**[ReCeCo](http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~Citilab/ReCeCo)** - A behemoth of a PMS we built at the Citilab during dark times. Written in Pharo Smalltalk and the Iliad web framework. With [Edutec](http://edutec.citilab.eu).  
**[Smalltalk Tutor](http://www.squeaksource.com/smalltalkTutor.html)** - An online programming school I was hired by the Citilab to build. Built with Pharo Smalltalk, the Iliad web framework and Amber (called JTalk then). Unfortunately never finished.  
**[Neo4St](http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~Citilab/Neo4St)** - An incomplete library providing native bindings for the Neo4j graph database for Pharo Smalltalk.  
**[Scaena](http://scaenaweb.citilab.eu:8081/scaena)** - Generate technical riders for music bands. Never completely finished, but quite functional. Source is [here](http://www.squeaksource.com/scaena).  
**[Scat](https://code.google.com/archive/p/scat/)** - An accidentally terribly named attempt to port Scratch to Pharo Smalltalk. A new team took over and now it's called [Phratch](http://www.phratch.com). With [Joan Güell](https://www.citilab.eu/en/equip/joan-guell/), [Serge Stinckwich](http://www.doesnotunderstand.org/).  
**[Rescorer](http://bromagosa.github.io/rescorer/)** - Learn to read sheet music playfully with [Biel Ballester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biel_Ballester) as your reading coach (in Catalan). Written in Amber Smalltalk.  
**[Scorer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/scorer/)** - The first Rescorer prototype. Helps you learn to read sheet music playfully. Written in Squeak Smalltalk.  
**[My BASIC Oldies](https://gitlab.com/bromagosa/myBasicOldies)** - The oldest programs written by me that I've managed to recover. The older ones written in an MSX died somewhere inside a cassette tape.  


## Some of my own Snap<em>!</em> Projects
**[Here's a collection](https://snap.berkeley.edu/collection?username=bromagosa&collection=my+own+favs)** of some of the Snap*!* projects I'm most proud of.

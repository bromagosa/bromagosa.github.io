Hi there!  

I am a software engineer from Barcelona. I am part of the [MicroBlocks](http://microblocks.fun) and [Snap<em>!</em>](http://snap.berkeley.edu) teams. I have been programming computers since I was a little kid and my family acquired an MSX computer with a BASIC interpreter.  

While I was in college, I learned [Smalltalk](http://wiki.c2.com/?SmalltalkLanguage) at a course given by Dr. [Jordi Delgado](https://www.cs.upc.edu/~jdelgado/) at the [Citilab](http://citilab.eu) (Cornell√†, Barcelona), where I was later hired to develop an online programming school. After that, and as part of the [Edutec](http://edutec.citilab.eu) project, I worked on developing a social knowledge management system, different educational applications, and a bunch of [Snap<em>!</em>](http://snap.berkeley.edu) modifications, like [Snap4Arduino](https://snap4arduino.rocks) or [Beetle Blocks](https://beetleblocks.com). After 6 years working at the Citilab I was hired by Arduino SRL, where I worked for a year and a half on further developing and maintaining [Snap4Arduino](http://snap4arduino.rocks).  

I did three years of freelancing for different Snap<em>!</em> and MicroBlocks related projects, and in 2020 I started working at SAP in 2020 as part of the [Young Thinkers](https://pages.community.sap.com/topics/young-thinkers) group, from where I support the [Beauty and Joy of Computing](http://bjc.berkeley.edu) project and contribute to the Snap<em>!</em> and MicroBlocks programming languages.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a Master's degree in Free Software. I am an avid GNU/Linux user and a supporter of a bunch of Free Software projects.  

The [MicroBlocks](http://microblocks.fun) project is actively looking for funding, so if you know of any funding opportunities please let us know.  

You can reach me at bernat (at) romagosa (dot) work, and you can also check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/bromagosa) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/bromagosa), or follow me on [Mastodon](https://mastodont.cat/@bromagosa).

Hi there!  

I am a software engineer from Barcelona. I am part of the [microBlocks](http://microblocks.fun) team, author of [Snap4Arduino](http://snap4arduino.org), main developer of [Beetle Blocks](http://beetleblocks.com) and a contributor to the [Snap<i>!</i>](http://snap.berkeley.edu) programming language. I have been programming computers since I was a little kid and my family acquired an MSX computer with a BASIC interpreter. I learned LOGO at school and became fascinated by live environments and high level languages. I was hired by my school right after graduation, becoming the person in charge of its computer department and an eventual teacher.  

While I was in college, I learned [Smalltalk](http://wiki.c2.com/?SmalltalkLanguage) at a course given by Dr. [Jordi Delgado](https://www.cs.upc.edu/~jdelgado/) at the [Citilab](http://citilab.eu) (Barcelona), where I was later hired to develop an online programming school. After that, and as part of the [Edutec](http://edutec.citilab.eu) project, I worked on developing a social knowledge management system, different educational applications, and a bunch of [Snap<em>!</em>](http://snap.berkeley.edu) modifications, like [Snap4Arduino](http://snap4arduino.rocks). After 6 years working at the Citilab I was hired by Arduino SRL, where I worked for a year and a half on further developing and maintaining [Snap4Arduino](http://snap4arduino.rocks).  

I am part of the [Beauty and Joy of Computing](http://bjc.berkeley.edu) project, where I contribute to the [Snap<em>!</em>](http://snap.berkeley.edu) programming language/environment.  

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a Master's degree in Free Software. I am an avid GNU/Linux user and a member of the Free Software Foundation Europe. 

I am currently freelancing, so if you have a project related to Snap<em>!</em> for me, drop me a line. 

The [microBlocks](http://microblocks.fun) project is actively looking for funding, so if you know of any funding opportunities please let us know.

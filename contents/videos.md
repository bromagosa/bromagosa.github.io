In [my YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_EJUQg4zmOP3uoDIg_zRdg) channel you'll find lots of Snap4Arduino-related videos.  

I also keep a [Snap4Arduino playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5OeDsbY1ElLa5FvQoejTFddsVZpp8Nah) with videos I keep finding around YouTube, and a -so far- tiny [Beetle Blocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AFnVXoJqhU&list=PL5OeDsbY1ElLR_2maAXzM7WcKHA8q9ZH9) one.  

[Here](https://vimeo.com/31597779)'s a 2011 screencast where I develop a simple snake game in Ludus, my now obsolete Amber Smalltalk game framework.  

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H740N28zJyM)'s a very short video where I introduce [Beetle Blocks](http://beetleblocks.com) for a local TV. (In Catalan)  

[Here](https://video.fosdem.org/2017/AW1.126/ogd_snap.mp4)'s a talk [Jens MÃ¶nig](http://github.com/jmoenig) and I gave at FOSDEM 2017, about Snap<i>!</i>, Snap4Arduino and Beetle Blocks.  

[Here](https://www.facebook.com/kelly.brieger/videos/10155230471170135/)'s a video that my friend [Kelly Brieger](https://twitter.com/KellyBriegerPR) live-streamed, where I demoed Snap4Arduino to passer-bys at the Maker Faire Bay Area in 2017. And [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8LiTWGNvK8)'s another short demo from that same event.  

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Baox7w8D_TA)'s a talk I gave at Scratch@Bordeaux2017 about Snap4Arduino.  

[Here](https://magsamond.com/2018/02/04/so-what-good-is-scratch-you-ask-a-perfect-pitch-3-minutes-answer-from-bromagosa/)'s a short conversation between my friend [Mags Amond](https://magsamond.com) and me about why Scratch is relevant and totally not just a toy.

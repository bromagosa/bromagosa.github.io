In [my YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_EJUQg4zmOP3uoDIg_zRdg) channel you'll find lots of Snap4Arduino-related videos.  

I also keep a [Snap4Arduino playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5OeDsbY1ElLa5FvQoejTFddsVZpp8Nah) with videos I keep finding around YouTube, and a -so far- tiny [Beetle Blocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AFnVXoJqhU&list=PL5OeDsbY1ElLR_2maAXzM7WcKHA8q9ZH9) one.  

[Here](https://video.fosdem.org/2017/AW1.126/ogd_snap.mp4)'s a talk [Jens MÃ¶nig](http://github.com/jmoenig) and I gave at FOSDEM 2017, about Snap<i>!</i>, Snap4Arduino and Beetle Blocks.
